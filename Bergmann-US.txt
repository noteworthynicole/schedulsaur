As a student, I want to see how many units I will have to take each quarter to graduate within a certain date, so I know how many classes I should take each quarter to stay on track.

As a fourth year, I want to see what classes I have left to graduate, so I can prioritize taking those classes.

As a student planning what classes to take spring quarter, I want to see only the classes offered spring quarter, so I don’t plan to take a class that is not offered at the time.
