Ok, so this section requires an explanation.

Each curriculum between CSC/SE has a main curriculum file, consisting of every class, titled <major>_curr.txt.

Each curriculum then has three separate files with major/support/electives. Unfortunately, my scraping abilities only get me so far, and so I couldn't scrape the different "or" statements for each curriculum. For example, both CSC/SE have life science support electives, consisting of a bunch of choices. In each curriculum file, these are listed consecutively with no notation showing that you only have to take one, not all of them.

It's best to look at the actual curriculums for more information.
