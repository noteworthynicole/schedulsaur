Here's what I did (your mileage may vary b/c I'm on linux)

- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (I did 10.15.3 LTS)
- It should (?) come with npx/npm
- Follow [these instructions under the heading "Quick Overview"](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- You can probably just copy+paste two of my files into the app you make
  - I edited these two files: /src/App.js and /src/App.css
  - Hopefully that works
